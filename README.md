Get your Expo app running quickly with these two commands:

## Getting Started ðŸš€

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Development Server:** Once the installation is complete, start the Expo development server with:

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

    This will build your app, open the Expo Metro Bundler in your web browser, and display a QR code in your terminal. You can then use the Expo Go app on your physical device (iOS or Android) to scan the QR code and open your app. Alternatively, you can run it on an iOS simulator (if you're on macOS with Xcode installed) by pressing `i` in the terminal, or on an Android emulator by pressing `a`.
